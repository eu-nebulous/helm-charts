- This helm chart for ProActive provides ready-to-use Kubernetes configurations that enable you running ProActive Workflows and Scheduling as a set of Pods.
- It allows you to start the following Pods:
  * ProActive Server Pod
  * (Optional) ProActive Static Nodes Pod
  * (Optional) ProActive Dynamic Nodes Pod
  * (Optional) ProActive Database Pod (PostgreSQL). The Database Pod is not started when using an embedded HSQL Database.

- The installation settings could be configured beforehand using the "values.yaml" file. More info about the different properties to set up is given in the README.md file.

- The ProActive Pods pull the container images from the Private Activeeon Docker Registry.
- To be able to pull images, a ProActive enterprise licence and access credentials are required.
